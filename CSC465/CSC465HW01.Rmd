# Question 1

## a)
Adding a constant *c* in each response *Y* means we can rewite the original model as $Y+C = \beta_0  + \beta_1 X+C$, which is $Y+C = (\beta_0 + C) + \beta_1 X$. So, the new $\beta_1$ is equal to the previous one and th new $\beta_0$ is equal to the original $\beta_0 + c$.


## b)
